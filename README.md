Bike sharing systems are a new version of conventional bike rentals in which the entire process
of joining, renting, and returning the bike is automated. These systems allow users to borrow a
bike from a certain location and return it to a different location. There are currently around 500
bike-sharing schemes operating throughout the world, with over 500 thousand bicycles.
Because of their importance in traffic, environmental, and health concerns, these systems are
generating a lot of interest nowadays.
It's critical to make rental bikes available and accessible to the public; otherwise,
providing the city with a consistent supply of rental bikes will become a huge worry. The most
important component is predicting the number of rental bikes that will be needed at each hour.
Therefore, the objective of this project is to predict bike rental count hourly or daily based on
the environmental and seasonal settings in year 2011-2012 using several Machine learning
techniques and algorithms.
